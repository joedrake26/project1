1. I really liked the organization of this site. Everything was neat and easy on the eyes from a user perspective. The navigation bar was easily accessible and had an aesthetic design that implemented different hovering techniques. The sections of the site each had an independent layout/format that gave a unique appeal to each page.

2. The big difference between this site and mine was the main content as well as the layout/format. My site focuses on pictures and therefore I reused the same layout for the majority of my pages and divded them by type of art. On the other hand, this site has more thought out content that can be layed out differently based on the information trying to be relayed.
    1. I believe this site has the better user experience due to its multi-layout and well organized content. Although my site has an aesthetic appeal, it's repetitive in its layout and content.
    2. On the other hand, due to my site being repetitive, it is much easier to maintain especially since it only needs one css file. The format is mostly shared throughout each page meaning one change can affect all pages.

3. As stated before, this site's strong points are its structuring and organization between sections. The information is easy to comprehend and not busy. The layout changes depending on the type of information, taking advantage of the best way to display it.
    1. One change I would make to the site is vertically centering the text within the "The Band" and "Media" sections. The extra space is better off distributed than big chunks of empty space.

4. Resizing the window brings about several errors throughout the sections. The site did not make us of min-width to stop text from leaking over text boxes. There also could have been a better resizing method for the main page's photo because it leaves a lot of empty space when the width is shortened.
    1. Glancing over the code, semantically appropriate elemnts were used in the case of class vs id.
    2. Due to each section having a unique layout, several css files were used, but there were no duplication problems.

5. Overall, great site! :)
